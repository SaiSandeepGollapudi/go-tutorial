# method
1. Go does not have classes like java. However, we can define methods on structs/types.

A method is a function where we give special receiver the struct as argument. 

The receiver appears in its own argument list between the func keyword and the method name.

# Functions
A function can take zero or more arguments. for arguments the data type comes after the variable name. When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.

We mention data type of function like int.
